# Add Netlify CMS to Your Site

Netlify CMS is adaptable to a wide variety of projects. The only inflexible requirement is that your site content must be written in markdown, JSON, YAML, or TOML files, stored in a repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/) or [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/). You can also create your own custom backend, or if you're interested in Bitbucket support, that's [coming soon](https://github.com/netlify/netlify-cms/pull/525).

This tutorial will guide you through the steps for adding Netlify CMS to a site that's built with a common [static site generator](https://www.staticgen.com/), like Jekyll, Hugo, Hexo, or Gatsby. Alternatively, you can [start from a template](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/start-with-a-template) or dive right into to [configuration options](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/configuration-options).
